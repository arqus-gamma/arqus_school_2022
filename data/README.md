This folder contains the datasets used for this school.

There are observations from different experiments, both at ground level and in space.

These are the "inputs" for the analysis scripts in this repository, the data files prepared with other codes.

The data is in FITS format. See https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/ .

Each folder also contains a README with some notes.
